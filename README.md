# tDiagnosableStructures
(2019) Application used for t-diagnostic structures optimization.

This program using my own reduction algorithm which determines matrix rows contains redundant 
diagnostic informations and collecting only existing data which is used to iterate on it (realizes only minimum needed iterations).
Basing on collected data, program is able to cut redundant data from matrix and return optimized graph structure.
Additionally application has feature to check validity of optimized graph using Hakimi and Amin mathematical theorem.

Using optimized t-diagnosis structure provides many benefits in IT systems - saving energy, money and computing power maintaining the same diagnosis effectiveness.
